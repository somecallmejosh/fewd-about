    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p><strong>I'm a dad of two, husband of one</strong>. By day, I design multiplatform fantasy sporting applications at <a href="http://sportstechinc.com">Sports Technologies, LLC</a>. In my spare time, I play music and enjoy traveling with my family.</p>
    <p>My family is very important to me. I really enjoy taking little day trips around New England. Education is a very important part of my life. My biggest personal expense goes to learning new concepts and ideas. If I'm not spending time learning for work, I'm probably studying/practicing music.</p>
